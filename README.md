** 3 news unoffial app **
>23 August 2014
This is a windows 8.1 app which runs on both desktop and mobile devices.
It is currently in it's VERY early stages and working on it as part of the MSA programme.
However, no more progress will be made on this application until I finish several assignments and tests.

Features/Changes penciled in thus far:
- Text to voice
- Link to the actual article when clicking on thumbnail instead of the short summary provided by 3 news
- Sharing options (whether that be on social media/email or sending a link of the article via text)
- Contemplating whether to add a "weather" section, personally think it'd be a waste of space as no one (that I know) 
	would use an app such as this for the weather.
- Better splash screen image

Any and all suggestions are welcome.
